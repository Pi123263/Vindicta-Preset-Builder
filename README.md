# Vindicta-Preset-Builder
Small GUI tool to create presets for Vindicta more easily.

This tool is a GUI application that I made to help people create presets for the Arma 3 Vindicta addon more easily.

A short How-To:

As the help button inside the GUI explains I recommend using this tool by placing down the units you want to use in the editor,
and then one by one exporting their classnames (Right click on unit -> Log -> Log Classes (iirc)) and pasting those classnames into
the corresponding field inside the GUI, once you're done adding classnames just add the Factions name in the corresponding field 
in the lower left of the GUI and then press the generate button, select a save location for the file and you should be good to go
to add the preset to the Vindicta addon.

TL;DR:
1. Place down units in 3DEN Editor
2. Paste Classnames into corresponding textfield one by one
3. Add Faction Name
4. Press generate button
5. Choose save location
6. Add preset to Vindicta mission
7. Ta-da!

Note that this tool is not an official Vindicta tool and support requests are not to be asked in the Vindicta discord, if you need
support either create an issue here on the GitHub page or send me (Pi123263#4857) a PM on Discord.
